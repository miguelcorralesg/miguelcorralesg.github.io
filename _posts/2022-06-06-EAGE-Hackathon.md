Hello everybody, welcome to a new post.  This post is related to my first participation in a Hackathon in Madrid, Spain, as part of the EAGE 2022 Annual exhibition. 

# EAGE Hackathon 2022

The topic of this year was Explainable Artificial Intelligence. The primary purpose was to apply techniques that allow explaining what a model is doing (mostly related to the geoscience aspect). Most of the time, machine learning models are considered a `black box` where the user has no idea what is happening. In this context, having access or knowledge of what the model 'is looking at' is helpful to determine if it is following some physical insights or what an expert in the area normally will do. More importantly, to know if it considers the `correct features`. 


# The SnorIAX Team

In this participation, the team was conformed of 4 KAUST students.  From left to right, [Miguel Corrales](https://dig.kaust.edu.sa/people/detail/miguel-corrales), Abdullah Alali, Danilo Chamorro, Randy Harsuko.

# Our approach

<!-- The problem to solve lies on Juan's research <d-cite key="doi:10.1190/image2022-3737749.1"></d-cite>. The main challenge is related to a segmentation step, where many independent bisection problems are needed to solve, which makes a perfect setting to optimize the running time performance using GPUs.  -->


# Results

<!-- After one day and a half, the team succesfully levaraged the capabilities of the algorithm. Roghly speaking, the team speed up the computation by 80 times. The code of the hackathon could be find in the following[`repository`](https://github.com/DIG-Kaust/HPC_Hackathon_DIG)

# Insights and comments 

<!-- It was such a wonderful experience to participate in this event. Many thanks to the organizers from KAUST and NVIDIA, and of course, for all the support from the mentors who constantly help along this short journey. Luckily, the team was awarded the best team in terms of computing performance.

# Illustrative experience
<!-- This was a post regarding the KAUST-NVIDIA Hackathon, here it is a illustrative summary related to our teamwork.   

"It's gonna be easy, probably just putting our code on numba and cuda", that is what we thought :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
