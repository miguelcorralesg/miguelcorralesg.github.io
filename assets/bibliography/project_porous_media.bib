abstract = {The reconstruction of porous media is of great interest in a wide variety of fields, including earth science and engineering, biology, and medicine. To predict multiphase flow through geologically realistic porous media it is necessary to have a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the pore space. Multiple-point statistics were used, based on two-dimensional (2D) thin-sections as training images, to generate 3D pore space representations. The method was borrowed from geostatistical techniques that use pixel-based representations to reproduce large-scale patterns. Thin-section images can provide multiple-point statistics, which describe the statistical relation between multiple spatial locations. Assuming that the medium is isotropic, a 3D image can be generated that preserves typical patterns of the void space seen in the thin sections. The method is tested on Fontainebleau and Berea sandstones for which 3D images from micro-CT scanning are available. The use of multiple-point statistics predicts long-range connectivity of the structures (measured by local percolation probability) better than standard two-point statistics methods. The selection of multiple-point statistics is a key issue and is discussed in detail.}

   abstract = "Linking the pore-scale and reservoir-scale subsurface fluid flow remains an open challenge in areas such as oil recovery and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). One of the main factors hindering our knowledge of such a process is the scarcity of physical samples from geological areas of interest. One way to tackle this issue is by creating accurate, digital representations of the available rock samples to perform numerical fluid flow simulations. Recent advancements in Machine Learning and Deep Generative Modeling open up a new promising avenue for generating realistic digital rock samples at low cost. This is particularly the case for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) due to their ability to learn complex high-dimensional distributions and produce high-quality samples. The present study introduces a novel Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) to generate 3D high-quality porous media samples. Moreover, a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics inspired by the geometry and topology of the structure and the fluid flow properties is established to assess the quality of the generative process."
