The 3D porous media generation using a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty **(here named as RockGAN)** was born as part of a course project at KAUST. The main inspiration comes from the novel ideal of [`Lukas Mosser `](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.96.043309), which consisted of applying Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as a new tool to generate random samples corresponding to a rock sample of interest rather than applying the conventional  [`multi-point statistics`](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092041050400124X).
