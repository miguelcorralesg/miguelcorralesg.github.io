The 3D porous media generation using a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty **(here named as RockGAN)** was born as part of a course project at KAUST. The main inspiration comes from the novel ideal of Lukas Mosser <d-cite key="PhysRevE.96.043309"></d-cite>, which consisted of applying Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as a new tool to generate random samples corresponding to a rock sample of interest rather than applying the conventional multi-point statistics <d-cite key="OKABE2005121"></d-cite>.


## Workflow
Here, we take a similar but different approach. Our work is based on some key points from the paper  from Tego Karras at NVIDIA <d-cite key="karras2017progressive"></d-cite>. The main ideas are: 
- Growing progressively from low to high dimension (Critic in the opposite way).
- Use normalization just in one of the layers. 
- We tested different activation functions, at the end, better results were achieve using GELU. 
- We used the Wasserstein formulation with gradient penalty. 

The main workflow idea is expressed in the following figure:

## Results
Let us compare the results obtained with RockGAN and the training data of the Berea dataset.
