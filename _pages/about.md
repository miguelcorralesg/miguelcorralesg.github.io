Hello everyone  and welcome to my personal website :smiley: :v: !


I am a **Ph.D. candidate** in the Earth Science and Engineering Program at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). My research specializes in `uncertainty quantification` for `reservoir characterization`, leveraging the power of `Machine Learning`.  

My work focuses on bridging the gap between ML and subsurface imaging to address key challenges in the field. My expertise spans `Machine Learning`, `Geophysics`, and `Petroleum Engineering`.  

<!-- I have demonstrated outstanding academic achievement and am highly collaborative in my research by tackling challenges to bridge deep learning and subsurface imaging. My knowledge comprehends `deep learning`, `deep generative modeling`, `uncertainty quantification `, `fluid flow in porous media`, `percolation theory`, and `inverse problems`. -->


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
