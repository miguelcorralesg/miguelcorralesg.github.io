   abstract={The inversion of petrophysical parameters from seismic data represents a fundamental step in the reservoir characterization framework. However, the non-linearity of the rock-physics models that relate petrophysical properties to seismic pre-stack amplitudes makes such an inversion challenging. We propose a hybrid approach, where data-driven basis functions are learned from well-logs to directly link band-limited petrophysical reflectivities to pre-stack seismic data. Petrophysical parameters are subsequently obtained by means of regularized post-stack seismic inversion. By performing two modeling steps at training time and a single inversion step at inference time, our method aims to be more efficient and robust than conventional two-step inversion workflows. The proposed method is tested on a synthetic dataset from the Smeaheia reservoir model. Numerical results show that porosity is the best-inverted rock property, followed by water saturation and clay content. Moreover, the method is shown to be also applicable in the context of reservoir monitoring to invert time-lapse, pre-stack seismic data for water saturation changes.}

    abstract = { Reservoir characterization is a critical component in any oil and gas, geothermal, and CO2 sequestration project. A fundamental step in the process of characterizing the subsurface is represented by the inversion of petrophysical parameters from seismic data. However, this problem suffers from various uncertainty sources originating from inaccuracies in the measurements, modeling errors, and complex geological processes. Moreover, the non-linearity of the rock-physics model and Zoeppritz equation that constitute the modelling operator, further complicates the inversion process. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven approach where well-log information is used to obtain optimal basis functions that link band-limited petrophysical reflectivities to pre-stack seismic data. Subsequently, the inversion of such band-limited reflectivities for petrophysical parameters is framed in a Bayesian framework where a generative adversarial network is used to produce a geologically realistic prior distribution. The trained prior distribution is updated using the Stein Variational Gradient Descent and a set of representative solutions is produced that is consistent with the uncertainties in the data and the nonlinear operators. }

    abstract = "{Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) and Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) have recently gained global attention as promising techniques to mitigate net CO2 emissions. Within this framework, the Saudi Arabian 2030 vision targets the large-scale deployment of CCS and CCUS projects to promote its circular carbon economy. This study evaluates the potential for underground sequestration of CO2 emitted from industrial sources near Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which emit 46 Mton/year.A deterministic geologic model corresponding to the Unayzah Formation was constructed using published data incorporating sedimentary facies distribution, porosity, permeability, and connectivity. Compositional simulations were performed to assess the CO2 plume flow in the presence of conduits, barriers, and baffles. Similarly, injectivity and injection rate effects on solubility and residual trapping were evaluated. A sensitivity analysis and an uncertainty quantification study were carried out to obtain a probabilistic assessment of the total storage capacity and trapping contributions.The geological evaluation indicates that the area under Riyadh is unsuitable because the Triassic sandstones are too shallow, and the Paleozoic section was entirely removed by erosion during the Carboniferous. Alternatively, the Hawtah area, at 150 km south of Riyadh, is deemed suitable for CO2 sequestration. These sandstones are porous, permeable, tightly sealed, and correspond to hydrocarbon reservoirs in anticlinal structures along the Hawtah, Nuayyim, and Dilam trends. They are favorable for CO2 disposal outside oil and gas fields due to lateral and vertical permeability barriers and up-dip pinch-out against the Batin arch. Simulation results, fifty years after CO2 injection and two hundred fifty years of monitoring, show that the Unayzah Formation satisfies the conditions of capacity, injectivity, and seal efficiency required for technical feasibility.Furthermore, lower injection rates promote higher solubility and residual trapping due to gravity-controlled flow exceeding viscous and capillary forces. Residual trapping contributes ~ 50\\% to the storage, while solubility adds 10\\%. The variables that have a higher impact on secure trapping are residual gas saturation, water salinity, and permeability. The current CO2 storage capacity in the area evaluated exceeds 300 Megatons (Mt), and the assessment is still ongoing, with no vertical leakage through the caprocks of the Khuff and Sudair Formations.Overall, the novelty in this research focuses on the unprecedented use of public domain data to construct a detailed geological model of the Unayzah Formation in the Hawtah and Nuayyim area that allowed a better understanding of CO2 flow mechanisms in the reservoir and its capacity to store CO2. This study concludes that the Unayzah reservoir in the Kharj-Hawtah area is a viable candidate for secure CO2 disposal from industrial sources in Riyadh. }",
